                            <h2 id="the-protocol">The Protocol:</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is changing the way we view money, value, payments and much more. It’s meteoric rise has grabbed the attention of both ordinary people and global institutions, with its open-source technology (blockchain) opening up a new world of opportunities and possibilities.</p>

<p>There are now over 300 different cryptocurrencies and the industry continues to see major blue chip companies, and governments experimenting and starting to implement blockchain technology, whether it be for efficiencies through ‘permissioned’ blockchains or through decentralized solutions.</p>

<p>Many of these ‘alternatives’ are little more than clones of a few key protocols, many lack the development teams, or technical knowledge to achieve their goals, many are rushed into launch before the being properly tested and many more lack the structure, or treasury model to build a sustainable solution.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is in its infancy and is constantly evolving, but already most blockchain solutions are based on protocols that are constantly being ‘patched’ (as the fiat banking system has been for 20 years!).</p>

<p>The Cardano protocol has been designed from the ‘ground-up’ and is a true step-change in blockchain’s evolution.</p>

<p>Just as bitcoin reinvented money, value and payments, the Cardano protocol reinvents blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="technological-innovation">Technological Innovation</h2>

<p>Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform. It is the first protocol to evolve from a scientific philosophy, meaning the code is more sophisticated, secure and the solution more advanced than other platforms. Our large team of expert engineers and researchers drawn from around the world started by deconstructing the concept of a cryptocurrency. Then, incorporating our ground-breaking Proof of Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, the IOHK team employed a first principles approach driven by peer reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.</p>

<p>This uniquely collaborative effort steadily constructed the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet, a product that brings together such disciplines as distributed systems, mechanism design and cryptography. The result is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, an industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case securing investment.</p>

<p>Cardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has at its foundation a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run next-generation smart contracts. The control layer will be programmed to recognise identity, assisting compliance and allowing blacklisting for instance.</p>

<p>The protocol’s design is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies. In addition, while the platform has been solidly composed, we also recognise the need for it to evolve and adapt to changing needs. Consequently we have designed a system that can be upgraded by way of soft forks, and are installing a treasury system that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.</p>

<p>Completely open source and patent-free, Cardano was built in a spirit of collaboration. And engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem is developing out into the most complete and most useful cryptocurrency ever constructed.</p>

<h2 id="conceptual-innovation">Conceptual Innovation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Privacy vs. Regulation
    <ul>
      <li>The original Bitcoin blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right. But full anonymity can be counterproductive, as can complete lack of regulatory oversight. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think a next-generation blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Governance
    <ul>
      <li>Public, decentralized blockchain projects like Bitcoin rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. But if not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum’s case already causing a split. We believe that next-generation blockchains must have airtight governance models that allow the community to engage in productive debate and then democratically take clear and binding decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Funding
    <ul>
      <li>In the original Bitcoin blockchain the network is maintained and built out by the Bitcoin community itself. But large-scale networks designed to do much more than Bitcoin can will also have more sophisticated maintenance and development needs. To be successful, a next-generation blockchain should be able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-token-ada-voucher">The Token: ADA Voucher</h2>

<p>Every blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. ADA is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With ADA you may send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. Performing transfers on the settlement layer will require that you already own ADA, or that you acquire ADA through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.</p>

<p>The project was funded through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a typical crowdsale mechanism in the blockchain industry. The ICO, as well as the distribution of ADA vouchers purchased in the crowdfund was executed by Attain Corp. Upon launch of the settlement layer in 2017, these vouchers may be redeemed for ADA which can be used on the settlement layer.</p>

<h2 id="the-wallet-daedalus">The Wallet: Daedalus</h2>

<p>Each cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store ADA. Typically this wallet is a software application that you can install on your personal computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a wallet that was developed by IOHK specifically for the Cardano blockchain.</p>

<p>Daedalus is a highly engineered wallet with advanced security features, protecting your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future Daedalus will not only support ADA, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic and many more.</p>

<p>In the spirit of open source blockchain projects, anyone is free to develop their own wallet.</p>

<p>Daedalus is a wallet that was developed by IOHK specifically for the Cardano blockchain, and the test version is available to download <a href="https://test.daedaluswallet.io/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cardano-testnet">Cardano Testnet</h2>

<p>Prior to launch we are releasing a number of Testnet versions so that we can fix any bugs or problems with Daedalus and the wider protocol.</p>

<p>Testnet 0.3 is currently available for download and testing  <a href="https://test.daedaluswallet.io/">here</a>.
You can participate in the test by downloading the Daedalus wallet, and following this youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfv7Ha8cPps">tutorial</a>.</p>
