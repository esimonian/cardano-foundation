# Project overview

## What is Cardano Project?

** **

Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform, more advanced than any protocol yet developed, and the first to evolve out of a scientific philosophy. Built by a large international team of expert engineers and researchers, Cardano is founded upon peer-reviewed academic research.

The Cardano platform allows provably secure transfers of value whilst balancing the needs of regulators with those of consumer privacy and protection. We aim to bring maturity, security and transparency to an industry that will require them to thrive. For applications that require regulatory interface, we provide the tools to manage the interactions with the incentive of provable security.

The platform is being built in stages, with intentional separation between settlement and computation. The value token ADA is the native cryptocurrency on the settlement layer expected to launch and be tradable on exchanges in May 2017. The computation layer is currently scheduled for launch in early 2018.

## Who is involved in the project and what are their roles?



The Cardano project was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014.[ Input Output HK](https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/) (IOHK) was engaged to design and implement the Cardano protocol. In addition, the[ Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/), based in Switzerland, was created to help oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem, and to advocate on behalf of the users of the protocol. Another entity, the[ Cardano Group](http://cardano.io/), based in the Isle of Man, was created to pursue for-profit activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities are wholly separate in ownership and leadership. Lastly, the[ Attain Corporation](http://attaincorp.co.jp/en/), was given sole rights to distribute and perform the token presale.

### Role of the foundation

The **Cardano Foundation** acts as a supervisory and educational body for the protocol, and as such we have a number of roles and responsibilities. We aim to educate and promote the Cardano protocol, fostering a community of engaged parties and acting as an information hub. Through contacts with authorities we hope to influence blockchain regulation, which will be critical for the long-term success of the platform. Finally, we will aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for a protocol’s long-term success and critical in enterprise adoption and government engagement.

### Role of IOHK

IOHK is a world-class engineering and research company that has developed a huge amount of capabilities, from setting up research centres, to hiring the best scientists in the field and well over a dozen Haskell developers, including one of the creators of Haskell. They have brought in very highly regarded firms, Well Typed and FP Complete, to review the Cardano code, to give the very highest assurances of security, adopting a first principles approach in building the software stack.

IOHK is contracted to design, build, and maintain the platform through to 2020. In 2017 the focus will be on the settlement layer, and 2018 the focus will be on the control layer. In 2019 IOHK will concentrate on long-term maintenance, scalability, sustainability, and 2020 will be focused on finessing the technology already built.

### Role of CGG

CGG is an investment focused entity that will build and foster commercial applications in the ecosystem and promoting Cardano blockchain technology usage. As most of the business facing applications are dependent on the computation layer (set for release in 2018), CGG will focus first on establishing infrastructure, and once the ecosystem is ready for venture applications, staff teams and deploy resources.

CGG is currently establishing key research and development centers in the target geographies such as the Philippines and South Korea. CGG will deploy capital and resources in two ways. First, it will build from a foundational level by identifying, aiding, and investing in early stage blockchain companies building on the Cardano technology stack. Second, from a growth standpoint CGG will invest in subsidiaries focusing on industry specific verticals and create new for-profit ventures to consult, educate, and integrate mature companies into the Cardano blockchain stack.

### Role of Attain

[Attain Corporation](http://attaincorp.co.jp/en/) is a Japanese company that was given sole rights to distribute and perform the token presale whilst maintaining compliance operations such as KYC and AML controls. They are also responsible for distributing the sold vouchers to each purchaser.

# Technology

## What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a database that is stored, maintained, and controlled by a network in contrast to traditional databases which are operated by a central or trusted third party. Blockchain technology makes it possible to create a digital record of events such as a financial transaction, sending a message, or exchanging the deed to property without any verification from a trusted third party. Instead, the network’s many participants ensure that tampering and malicious behavior cannot occur because all the transactions are verified by the entire network, meanwhile the information is encrypted so that users do not sacrifice privacy or security.



## What is innovative about the Cardano blockchain?

The Cardano blockchain differs from other blockchains in philosophy, technology and scale. The basic vision focuses on technological, social, and economic improvements to questions like:

* If you were to rebuild Bitcoin today, what would it look like?

* Is it possible to bridge consumer protection and privacy with regulation?

* Can you build world a class blockchain platform while adhering to precedents held by the top academic and commercial software standards?

* How do you keep the project going long term from a technological and economic perspective?

The Cardano project has already secured arguably the top collection of talent in the blockchain industry. The development team boasts an impeccable academic pedigree, with no fewer than 12 PHD’s contributing research to the project encompassing one of the largest development teams of any cryptocurrency including bitcoin. In the spirit of blockchain and cryptocurrency projects before it, the Cardano stack will be completely open source and patent-free.

### The third way, bridging protection and privacy with regulation

Current blockchain solutions are at odds with one another, occupying the extremes on a spectrum between complete anonymity such as Zcash and Monero to being only focused on regulators needs such as Ripple or R3CEV. The Cardano project was founded on the belief that consumer protection and regulatory compliance are not mutually exclusive concepts, and that a middle ground is possible.

A multi-layer stack not only allows for better scalability for businesses building applications, but it also has the power to bridge the aforementioned gap by allowing for customizable computation environments where developers can tailor their software rules to meet the requirements of a jurisdiction or regulatory body.

### Separating value from computation - a layered approach

The first blockchain projects such as Bitcoin focused solely on simple value transactions. Later blockchain inventions such as Ethereum sought to build a global supercomputer on which to write smart contracts and build decentralized applications. However no project has been able to adequately and elegantly combine the two.

The Cardano platform features a multi-layer stack, separating the processes of settlement and computation into different layers. This separation enables greater usability, whilst maintaining the highest levels of security. Users can get all the benefits of cryptocurrency in terms of censorship free value transaction and guarantees of privacy and protection on the settlement layer, while on the computation layer developers can build customized applications which can meet regulatory needs such as KYC/AML controls and tax reporting.

Each layer of the stack can function independently - users have the choice to solely operate within the censorship resistant monetary layer, or enter into an individual application where they must abide by the rules of that particular application. The the value of the Cardano blockchain is fully realized when individuals’, businesses’, and regulators’ incentives are aligned in interactions between settlement and computation layers.

Another advantage of maintaining a separate value layer is reduction of ‘bloat’ on the computing blockchain as it limits the amount of financial data that the computing layer must store, and application data that the settlement layer must store. Further potential of this blockchain architecture may be interoperability with other blockchains.

### High assurance software and provable security

The Cardano blockchain seeks to adhere to the highest standards of software development that have been established for both academic and commercial purposes.

High-assurance products are provably secure and reliable. Cardano is the first high-assurance blockchain. The system is the first cryptocurrency to be built in Haskell, which offers significant benefits as a functional programming language. It is powerful, offers ease of maintenance and means we can perform formal verification - the automatic checking of proofs - which gives much stronger assurances of security than traditional testing. This makes Cardano an industrial strength product built with the provable security assurances required for mission critical systems.

Cardano is the first blockchain to use[ Ouroborous, the first provably secure Proof of Stake algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf), developed by[ Aggelos Kiayias, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aggelos-kiayias-40a92712/), Chair in Cyber Security and Privacy at the[ University of Edinburgh](http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/aggelos-kiayias(8bf34ce8-09c6-4f1f-a575-df3c17a4a9d4).html).

Security must go beyond academic proofs however, and into the actual code implementation itself. The codebase is therefore subject to rigorous and independent **third party audit.** Global leading firms have been retained to perform these functions. FP Complete was hired to assess the quality of the Cardano code and documentation, whilst both Grimm and PRI have been hired to independently verify the security of the code. No other blockchain has undergone this kind of auditing.

Through the use of top quality academics and engineers, peer reviewed proofs of security, and independent auditing, Cardano can give the guarantees of formal security required for others to build large scale financial applications upon it where other blockchains cannot.

### Built for the long term

The Cardano project was built with a long term vision in mind. To achieve this it goal it must address two critical challenges from which other blockchain projects have suffered: governance and funding. Where projects like Bitcoin have been gridlocked by a slow decentralised decision making process to upgrade the software, or Ethereum looking for external capital after quickly exhausting initial reserves to fund long term development, the Cardano project plans to implement a governance system and treasury which address these issues indefinitely.

First, a decentralized governance process is planned which allows stakeholders - any ADA holder may express their will - to vote on upgrades and updates to the protocol and these improvements can take place through the use of soft forks.

Second, a treasury system will be implemented which creates a virtually endless funding mechanism. The treasury is funded through a portion of the block rewards, and the community can vote on how to use the capital pool to grow the ecosystem, from choosing which developers will maintain the system to funding new projects.

### When will the platform launch?

The first layer of the stack is the settlement layer, a fully functioning blockchain with ADA as the cryptocurrency, which will be tradable on exchanges, and set to release in mid 2017. The separate computing layer will be developed in 2017 and 2018, with a minimum viable project slated for release in Q1 of 2018.


### Can I see the code?

Yes, the entire project is open source. You can see the code at GitHub: https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/


### What is the relationship between ADA and the Cardano platform?

Exchange on a blockchain platform requires the use of a cryptographic value token, often referred to as a cryptocurrency. The native Cardano token is called ADA. Performing transfers on the settlement layer will require the ADA token, which will also be the cryptocurrency used in applications built on the computation layer.

*The ADA cryptocurrency is a key feature of the Cardano platform. Performing transfers of value on the settlement layer will require the ADA token, and it will also be the cryptocurrency used for applications built on the computation layer.*

### Block rewards

The remainder of ADA (~14,800,000,000) will be issued on the following schedule:

* 2000 ADA/block for the initial 3,744,961 blocks

* 1000 ADA/block for the subsequent 3,744,961 blocks

* 500 ADA/block for the subsequent 3,744,961 blocks

* and so on and so forth, in such a way that the ADA per block will be halved every 3,744,961 blocks, with 99.95% of the ADA remaining after presale issued after ~24 years

### Cardano Treasury

Of each ADA issued per block:

* 75% of it will be given to the protocol participants as a block reward

* 25% of it will be directed to a special address that is earmarked for the Cardano Treasury, from which developers and ecosystem participants could request the funding of their projects, and the stakeholders of the system would vote to approve or reject their proposals (The mechanism by which the Cardano Treasury will operate will not be available at the launch of Cardano but the mechanism and its implementation are currently under research and development)


### When will all the official information about ADA be released to the public?

The Cardano Foundation acts as a repository of information for the entire project. And we will continuously update our website to provide information.
