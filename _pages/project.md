# Project overview

The Cardano project is developing a next generation blockchain technology designed to build a new decentralised economy, and democratize finance in emerging markets. Cardano will allow decentralised applications and contracts to be built and executed, in a low-cost, secure and scalable way.

Blockchain has the potential to become a globally transformative technology, with global financial institutions spending over $1 billion dollars on blockchain technology in 2016 alone. However current solutions have been hampered by a number of critical issues: lack of regulatory oversight, experimental software development with unproven security, poor governance that stifles updates, and a lack of planning for the long term future of protocols.

The Cardano project openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture.

The protocol features an innovative layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. 

Cardano is structured with a democratic governance system that will let the project evolve over time, and fund itself indefinitely through a visionary treasury system.

# Project Stakeholders

{% include new-block-structure.html %}

The Cardano project was initiated by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, investors and entrepreneurs concentrated in Asia at the end of 2014.[ Input Output HK](https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/) (IOHK) was engaged to design and implement the Cardano protocol. In addition, the[ Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/), based in Switzerland, was created to help oversee and supervise the development of Cardano and its ecosystem, and to advocate on behalf of the users of the protocol. Another entity, the[ Cardano Group](http://cardano.io/), based in the Isle of Man, was created to pursue for-profit activities on behalf of the ecosystem and community. The three entities are wholly separate in ownership and leadership. Lastly, the[ Attain Corporation](http://attaincorp.co.jp/en/), was given sole rights to distribute and perform the token presale.

### The Cardano Foundation

The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for the protocol, and as such we have a number of roles and responsibilities. We aim to educate and promote the Cardano protocol, fostering a community of engaged parties and acting as an information hub. Through contacts with authorities we hope to influence blockchain regulation, which will be critical for the long-term success of the platform. Finally, we will aid the creation of formal software standards for Cardano, a crucial feature for a protocol’s long-term success and critical in enterprise adoption and government engagement.

### IOHK

IOHK is a world-class engineering and research company that has developed a huge amount of capabilities, from setting up research centres, to hiring the best scientists in the field and well over a dozen Haskell developers, including one of the creators of Haskell. They have brought in very highly regarded firms, Well Typed and FP Complete, to review the Cardano code, to give the very highest assurances of security, adopting a first principles approach in building the software stack.
IOHK is contracted to design, build, and maintain the platform through to 2020. In 2017 the focus will be on the settlement layer, and 2018 the focus will be on the control layer. In 2019 IOHK will concentrate on long-term maintenance, scalability, sustainability, and 2020 will be focused on finessing the technology already built.

### CGG

CGG is an investment focused entity that will build and foster commercial applications in the ecosystem and promote Cardano blockchain technology usage. As most of the business facing applications are dependent on the computation layer (set for release in 2018), CGG will focus first on establishing infrastructure, and once the ecosystem is ready for venture applications, staff teams and deploy resources. CGG is currently establishing key research and development centers in the target geographies such as the Philippines and South Korea. CGG will deploy capital and resources in two ways. First, it will build from a foundational level by identifying, aiding, and investing in early stage blockchain companies building on the Cardano technology stack. Second, from a growth standpoint CGG will invest in subsidiaries focusing on industry specific verticals and create new for-profit ventures to consult, educate, and integrate mature companies into the Cardano blockchain stack.

### Attain

Attain Corporation is a Japanese company that was given sole rights to distribute and perform the token presale whilst maintaining compliance operations such as KYC and AML controls. They are also responsible for distributing the sold vouchers to each purchaser.­­

# Project Road Map

With the benefit of a large and talented team of developers, the settlement layer and the computation layer are being worked on concurrently by two separate IOHK development teams.
 
IOHK will release a functioning version of the settlement layer in mid 2017. Once launched, you will be able to transact, trade, and purchase ADA (much like bitcoin) fully independent of the computation layer. Over the rest of 2017 there will be further work in building all the infrastructure up in a systematic and optimised way.
 
The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, people who wish to develop on the platform will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.
 
In 2019 IOHK intends to work on Cardano’s long-term scalability and augment its capabilities. As developers, IOHK has been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being adequately maintained. The goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem that solves real problems and can serve as an innovative financial framework for the developing world.

# Exchanges

The Cardano project has a dedicated team to reach out to exchanges that are interested in listing ADA. There has been considerable interest and we will update here when exchanges are confirmed. If you would like to enquire about listing ADA please contact us at info@cardanofoundation.org.
