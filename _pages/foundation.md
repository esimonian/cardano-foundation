The Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to “standardise, protect and promote” the Cardano Protocol technology.

# Areas of focus

* **Cardano Community**
  * We support, grow and help educate the nascent Cardano blockchain community.

* **Cardano Ecosystem**
  * We work to build up, expand and protect the Cardano ecosystem. This includes promoting Cardano as a platform for commercial entities and serving as an objective organization for enterprises interested in Cardano to join.

* **Cardano Protocol**
  * We function as an objective standards body for the Cardano protocol as it evolves over time.

* **Serving the wider blockchain community**
  * We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. Our strategy is to proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and to form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.
