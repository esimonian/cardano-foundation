## What is Cardano

The Cardano project is a next generation blockchain designed to build a new decentralised economy, and democratize finance in emerging markets. The Cardano project is one of the most ambitious projects ever.

Blockchain has the potential to become a globally transformative technology, with global financial institutions spent over $1 billion dollars on blockchain technology in 2016 alone. However current solutions have been hampered by a number of critical issues: lack of regulatory oversight, experimental software development with unproven security, poor governance that stifles updates, and a lack of planning for the long term future of protocols.

The Cardano blockchain openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. Cardano features an innovative layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry. Finally, Cardano is being built to last, with a democratic governance system that will let the project evolve over time, and fund itself indefinitely through a visionary treasury system.

You can read an overview of the Cardano Project by Foundation Chairman Michael Parson’s here: (link from media and press release sections)

#### The Protocol:

The Cardano protocol is a layered blockchain approach that you can read more about here(link to FAQ). The first layer offers similar functionality to bitcoin and is currently in its testing phase, prior to the actual rollout during May 2017. Further layers that add new functionality will be rolled out in the future.

You can participate in the test by downloading the Daedalus wallet, and following this youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfv7Ha8cPps).

## The Token: ADA Voucher

Every blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. ADA is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With ADA you may send money between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. Performing transfers on the settlement layer will require that you already own ADA or that you acquire ADA through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.

The project was funded through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a typical crowdsale mechanism in the blockchain industry. The ICO, as well as the distribution of ADA vouchers purchased in the crowdfund was executed by Attain Corp. Upon launch of the settlement layer in May these vouchers may be redeemed for ADA which can be used on the settlement layer.

## The Wallet: Daedalus

Each cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” where you can keep your ADA. Typically this wallet is a software application that you can install on your personal computer or smartphone.

Daedalus is a wallet that was developed by IOHK specifically for the Cardano blockchain, and the test version is available to download [here](https://test.daedaluswallet.io/).

It is a highly engineered wallet with advanced security features, protecting your assets with the strongest cryptography yet developed. In the future Daedalus will not only support ADA, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic and many more.

In the spirit of open source blockchain projects, anyone is free to develop their own wallet. As new wallets which support ADA become available, we will update the list.


## The Future: Road Map

With the benefit of a large and talented team of developers, the settlement layer and the computation layer are being worked on concurrently by two separate IOHK development teams.

IOHK will release a functioning version of the settlement layer in May 2017. Once launched, you will be able to transact, trade, and purchase ADA (much like bitcoin) fully independent of the computation layer. Over the rest of 2017 there will be further work in building all the infrastructure up in a systematic and optimised way.

The goal for the computation layer is to have a beta released by the first quarter of 2018. Once both settlement and computation layers are live, people who wish to develop on the platform will be able to setup a custom environment to build decentralised applications on the Cardano stack.

In 2019 IOHK will be working on Cardano’s long term scalability and augmenting its capabilities. IOHK as developers have been contracted through 2020 to make sure Cardano is being maintained and address any slippage. The goal at this point will be a sustainable ecosystem that solves real problems and can serve as a innovative financial framework for the developing world.


## How to get it: Exchanges

The Cardano project has a dedicated team to reach out to exchanges that are interested in listing ADA. There has been considerable interest and we will update here when exchanges are confirmed.
