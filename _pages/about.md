# Who we are

> The Cardano Foundation’s mission is to act as an objective supervisory and educational body for the Cardano Protocol -
> an innovative blockchain technology.
>
> We serve the Cardano community by creating an environment where advocates can aggregate and collaborate.

We aim to influence and progress the emerging commercial and legislative landscape for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Our strategy is to proactively approach government and regulatory bodies and to form strategic partnerships with businesses, enterprises and other open-source projects.

The Foundation’s core mission is to “standardise, protect and promote” the Cardano Protocol technology.
